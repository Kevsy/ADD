1.  Introduction

   [RFC7626] discusses DNS privacy considerations in both "on the wire"
   (Section 2.4) and "in the server" (Section 2.5) contexts.  In recent
   years there has also been an increase in available "public resolvers"
   [RFC8499] which DNS clients may use instead of the default resolvers
   provided by the network for a variety of reasons (e.g., offer a good
   reachability, support an encrypted transport, provide a strong
   privacy policy, (lack of) filtering).

   If public DNS over TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
   [RFC8484] servers are used instead of local DNS servers, it can
   adversely impact Enterprise network-based security.  Typically,
   various network security services are provided by Enterprise networks
   to protect endpoints (e.g., laptops, printers, IoT devices).  The
   network security services may, for example, prevent malware download,
   block known malicious URLs, enforce use of strong ciphers, stop data
   exfiltration, etc.  Further, Enterprises network security services
   may enforce Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) according to the IT and
   workplace policies.  For example, employees are not allowed to access
   some non-professional websites from the Enterprise network.  These
   network security services act on DNS requests originating from
   endpoints.  However, if an endpoint is configured to use public DoT
   or DoH servers, network security services cannot act on DNS requests
   from these endpoints without acting as a TLS proxy.

   In order to act on DNS requests from endpoints, network security
   services may block DoT traffic by dropping outgoing packets to

   destination TCP port number 853.  Identifying DoH traffic is far more
   challenging than DoT traffic.  Network security services may try to
   identify the well-known DoH resolvers by their domain name, and DoH
   traffic can be blocked by dropping outgoing packets to these domains.
   However, DoH traffic can not be fully identified without acting as a
   TLS proxy.

   If a network security service blocks access to the public DoH/DoT
   server, there are incompatibilities with the privacy profiles
   discussed in [RFC8310]:

   o  If an endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile (Section 5 of
      [RFC8310]), the endpoint cannot resolve DNS names.

   o  If an endpoint has enabled opportunistic privacy profile
      (Section 5 of [RFC8310]), endpoint will either fallback to an
      encrypted connection without authenticating the DNS server
      provided by the local network or fallback to clear text DNS, and
      cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages.  The fallback adversely
      impacts security and privacy as internal attacks are possible in
      Enterprise networks.  For example, an internal attacker can modify
      the DNS responses to re-direct the client to malicious servers or
      pervasively monitor the DNS traffic.  The reader may refer to
      Section 3.2.1 of [I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t] for a discussion
      on the need for more awareness about attacks from within closed
      domains.

   To overcome the above threats, this document specifies mechanisms to
   configure endpoints to use Enterprise provided DoT and DoH servers,
   and bootstrap IoT devices and unmanaged endpoints to discover and
   authenticate the DoT and DoH servers provided by the Enterprise
   network.

   This document focuses on Enterprise networks, DoH/DoT sever discovery
   considerations for home networks are discussed in [I-D.btw-add-home].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499] and
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter].

   'DoH/DoT' refers to DNS-over-HTTPS and/or DNS-over-TLS.

Internet-Draft       DoH/DoT in Enterprise Networks           March 2020


3.  IT-owned devices

   If a device is managed by an enterprise's IT department, the device
   can be configured to use Enterprise-provided DoH/DoT servers.  This
   configuration might be manual or rely upon whatever deployed device
   management tool in an Enterprise.  For example, customizing Firefox
   using Group Policy to use the Enterprise DoH server is discussed in
   [Firefox-Policy] for Windows and MacOS, and setting Chrome policies
   is discussed in [Chrome-Policy].

4.  IoT Devices

   Installing host agents may not be a viable option on IoT devices and
   network-based security is an efficient means to protect such IoT
   devices.  If an IoT device is configured to use public DoT or DoH
   servers, and if a policy enforcement point in the local network is
   programmed using, for example, a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD)
   file [RFC8520] by a MUD manager to only allow specific communications
   to and from the IoT device, the policy enforcement point cannot apply
   the network Access Control List (ACL) rules based on domain names
   (Section 8 of [RFC8520]).

   The following bootstrapping mechanisms can be used to securely
   provision IoT devices to use Enterprise provided DoT and DoH servers:

   o  IoT devices supporting Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
      Infrastructures (BRSKI) discussed in
      [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] can be bootstrapped with
      the Enterprise-provided DoH/DoT servers using the mechanism
      discussed in Section 5 of [I-D.reddy-dprive-bootstrap-dns-server].

   o  [RFC8572] defines a bootstrapping strategy for enabling devices to
      securely obtain the required configuration information with no
      installer input, the onboarding information defined in Section 2.2
      of [RFC8572] can be extended to include the local DoH/DoT server
      information.

   o  The following discusses Wi-Fi authentication mechanisms supported
      by IoT devices:

      EAP-PSK [RFC4764] realizes mutual authentication and session key
      derivation using a Pre-Shared Key (PSK).  Once the authentication
      is successful, EAP-PSK provides a protected communication channel.

      EAP-pwd [RFC8146] is another EAP method that utilizes a shared
      password for authentication using a PAKE scheme that is resistant
      to dictionary attacks.

Internet-Draft       DoH/DoT in Enterprise Networks           March 2020


      Not all of IoT devices support 802.1x supplicant and need an
      alternate mechanism to connect to the Enterprise network.  To
      address this limitation, unique pre-shared keys are created for
      each IoT device and WPA-PSK is used.  In other words, WPA-PSK is
      used with unique pre-shared keys for different IoT devices to deal
      with security issues.  EAP-PSK/EAP-pwd/WPA-PSK seems to be a good
      choice on constrained devices.

      *  For the above EAP methods and WPA-PSK, the IoT device needs to
         be provisioned with a PSK for mutual authentication.  The PSK
         is only known to the IoT device and the EAP/WPA server.  In
         this case, the bootstrapping mechanism discussed in Section 4
         of [I-D.reddy-dprive-bootstrap-dns-server] may be used to
         securely bootstrap IoT device with the authentication domain
         name (ADN) and DNS server certificate of the local network's
         DoH/ DoT server.  It uses password-based authenticated key
         exchange (PAKE) scheme to authenticate the EST server and fetch
         the DoH/DoT server certificate.

   o  If Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) [dpp] is used, the
      configurator can securely configure IoT devices with the local
      DoH/DoT server using DPP.

   o  The OMA LWM2M specification [oma] defines an architecture where a
      new device (LWM2M client) contacts a Bootstrap-server which can
      provision IoT devices with the local DoH/DoT server.

   o  The Open Connectivitiy Foundation [ocf] defines the onboarding
      process.  Once the onboarding tool and the new device have
      authenticated and established secure communication, the onboarding
      tool can provision the IoT device with the local DoH/DoT server.

   This document does not discuss opportunistic or leap-of-faith
   bootstrapping methods, they are susceptible to security issues (e.g.,
   IoT device can be configured with the attacker's DoH/DoT server or
   disable the use of DoH/DoT).

5.  BYOD

   The following mechanisms can be used to bootstrap BYOD (bring your
   own device):

   o  If mobile device management (MDM) is used to secure BYOD, MDM can
      be used to configure OS/browser with the Enterprise provided DoH/
      DoT server.

   o  If an endpoint is on-boarded, for example, using Over-The-Air
      (OTA) enrollment to provision the device with a certificate and

Internet-Draft       DoH/DoT in Enterprise Networks           March 2020


      configuration profile, the configuration profile can include the
      URI of the DoH server and authentication domain name (ADN) of the
      DoT server.  The OS/Browser can use the configuration profile to
      use the Enterprise provided DoH/DoT server.  In this case, MDM is
      not installed on the device.

   o  If an endpoint uses the credentials (username and password)
      provided by the IT admin to mutually authenticate to the
      Enterprise WiFi Access Point, the boostrapping mechanism discussed
      in Section 4 of [I-D.reddy-dprive-bootstrap-dns-server] can be
      used to securely bootstrap the endpoint with the ADN and DNS
      server certificate of the local network's DoH/DoT server.

      The DNS client uses PAKE scheme to authenticate the EST server
      using the credentials to authenticate to the network.  In this
      case, the endpoint is neither provisioned with a configuration
      profile or MDM is installed on the device.  Many users have
      privacy and personal data sovereignty concerns with employers
      installing MDM on their personal devices; they are concerned that
      admin can glean personal information and could control how they
      use their devices.  Yet when users do not install MDM on their
      devices, IT admins do not get visibility into the security posture
      of those devices.

      To overcome this problem, a host agent can cryptographically
      attest the security status associated with device, such as minimum
      passcode length, biometric login enabled, OS version etc.  This
      approach is fast gaining traction especially with the advent of
      closed OS like Windows 10 in S mode [win10s] or Chromebook
      [Chromebook], where applications are sandboxed (e.g., ransomware
      attack is not possbile) and applications can only be installed via
      the OS store.

6.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism defined in [I-D.reddy-dprive-dprive-privacy-policy] can
   be used by the DNS server to communicate its privacy statement URL
   and filtering policy to a DNS client.  This communication is
   cryptographically signed to attest to its authenticity.

   The DNS client can validate the signatory (i.e., cryptographically
   attested by the Organization hosting the DoH/DoT server) and the user
   can review human-readable privacy policy information of the DNS
   server and assess whether the DNS server performs DNS-based content
   filtering.

   If the discovered DoH/DoT server does not meet the privacy preserving
   data policy and filtering requirements of the user, the user can

   instruct the DNS client to take appropriate actions.  For example,
   the action can be to use the local DNS server only to access
   internal-only DNS names and use another DNS server (adhering with
   his/her expectations) for public domains.
