      <t>This document specifies mechanisms to bootstrap endpoints (e.g.,
      hosts, IoT devices) to discover and authenticate DNS-over-TLS and
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by a local network for IoT/BYOD devices
      in Enterprise networks.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Traditionally a caching DNS server has been provided by local
      networks. This provides benefits such as low latency to reach that DNS
      server (owing to its network proximity to the endpoint). However, if an
      endpoint is configured to use Internet-hosted or public DNS-over-TLS
      (DoT) <xref target="RFC7858"></xref> or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> servers, any available local DNS server cannot
      serve DNS requests from local endpoints. If public DNS servers are used
      instead of using local DNS servers, some operational problems can occur
      such as those listed below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>"Split DNS" <xref target="RFC2775"></xref> to use the special
          internal-only domain names (e.g., "internal.example.com") in
          enterprise networks will not work, and ".local" and "home.arpa"
          names cannot be locally resolved in home networks.</t>

          <t>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) that map traffic based on DNS
          may lose the ability to direct end-user traffic to a nearby
          service-specific cluster in cases where a DNS service is being used
          that is not affiliated with the local network and which does not
          send "EDNS Client Subnet" (ECS) information <xref
          target="RFC7871"></xref> to the CDN's DNS authorities <xref
          target="CDN"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If public DNS servers are used instead of local DNS servers, the
      following discusses the impacts on network-based security:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Various network security services are provided by Enterprise
          networks to protect endpoints (e.g,. Hosts, IoT devices).
          Network-based security solutions such as firewalls (FW) and
          Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) rely on network traffic
          inspection to implement perimeter-based security policies. The
          network security services may for example prevent malware download,
          block known malicious URLs, enforce use of strong ciphers, stop data
          exfiltration, etc. These network security services act on DNS
          requests originating from endpoints. However, if an endpoint is
          configured to use public DoH/DoT servers, network security services
          cannot act on DNS requests from these endpoints.</t>

          <t>In order to act on DNS requests from endpoints, network security
          services can block DoT traffic by dropping outgoing packets to
          destination port 853. Identifying DoH traffic is far more
          challenging than DoT traffic. Network security services may try to
          identify the domains offering DoH servers, and DoH traffic can be
          blocked by dropping outgoing packets to these domains. If an
          endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile (Section 5 of <xref
          target="RFC8310"></xref>), and the network security service blocks
          the traffic to the public DNS server, the DNS service won't be
          available to the endpoint and ultimately the endpoint cannot access
          Internet-reachable services.</t>

          <t>If an endpoint has enabled opportunistic privacy profile (Section
          5 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>), and the network security
          service blocks traffic to the public DNS server, the endpoint will
          either fallback to an encrypted connection without authenticating
          the DNS server provided by the local network or fallback to clear
          text DNS, and cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If the network security service fails to block DoH/DoT traffic, this
      can compromise the endpoint security; some of the potential security
      threats are listed below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The network security service cannot prevent an endpoint from
          accessing malicious domains.</t>

          <t>If the endpoint is an IoT device which is configured to use
          public DoH/DoT servers, and if a policy enforcement point in the
          local network is programmed using, for example, a Manufacturer Usage
          Description (MUD) file <xref target="RFC8520"></xref> by a MUD
          manager to only allow intended communications to and from the IoT
          device, the policy enforcement point cannot enforce the network
          Access Control List (ACL) rules based on domain names (Section 8 of
          <xref target="RFC8520"></xref>).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If the network security service successfully blocks DoT and DoH
      traffic, this can still compromise the endpoint security and privacy;
      some of the potential security threats are listed below:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Networks are susceptible to internal attacks as discussed in
          Section 3.2 of <xref
          target="I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t"></xref>. An internal
          attacker can modify the DNS responses to re-direct the client to
          malicious servers.</t>

          <t>Pervasive monitoring of DNS traffic.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In addition, the local network's DNS server is advertised using
      DHCP/RA which is insecure and also provides no mechanism to securely
      authenticate the DNS server. To overcome the above threats, this
      document specifies a mechanism to bootstrap endpoints to discover and
      authenticate the DoT and DoH servers provided by their local network.
      The overall procedure can be structured into the following steps:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t><xref target="bootstrap-endpoint">Bootstrapping</xref> is
          necessary only when connecting to a new network or when the
          network's DNS certificate has changed. Bootstrapping procedure
          authenticates the Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref
          target="RFC7030"></xref> server to the endpoint. After
          authenticating the EST server, DNS server certificate used by the
          local network is downloaded to the endpoint. This DNS server
          certificate enables subsequent authenticated encrypted communication
          with the local DNS server (e.g., DoH) during in the connection
          phase.</t>

          <t><xref target="auth">Connection handshake and service

          bootstrapping phase.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Note: ">The strict and opportunistic privacy profiles
          as defined in <xref target="RFC8310"></xref> only applies to DoT
          protocol, there has been no such distinction made for DoH
          protocol.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="scope" title="Scope">
      <t>The problems discussed in <xref target="intro"></xref> will be
      encountered in Enterprise networks. Typically Enterprise networks do not
      assume that all devices in their network are managed by the IT team or
      Mobile Device Management (MDM) devices, especially in the quite common
      BYOD ("Bring Your Own Device") scenario. The mechanisms specified in
      this document can be used by BYOD devices to discover and authenticate
      DoT and DoH servers provided by the Enterprise network. This mechanism
      can also be used by IoT devices (managed by IT team) after onboarding to
      discover and authenticate DoT and DoH servers provided by the Enterprise
      network.</t>

      <t>Wireless LAN as frequently deployed is vulnerable to various attacks
      (<xref target="Evil-Twin"></xref>,<xref target="Krack"> </xref> and
      <xref target="Dragonblood"></xref>). Because of these attacks, only
      cryptographically authenticated communications are trusted on Wireless
      LAN networks. This means information provided by such networks via DHCP,
      DHCPv6, or RA (e.g., NTP server, DNS server, default domain) are
      untrusted because DHCP and RA are not authenticated. <xref
      target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> discusses DoH/DoT server discovery
      using DHCP/RA but requires the DoH/DoT server to be pre-configured in
      the endpoint (OS or Browser) or the DNS client must be able
      cryptographically identify it is connecting to a DoT/DoH server hosted
      by a specific organization (e.g., ISP or Enterprise) (see <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref>) to prevent the
      client from connecting to a attackers server.</t>

      <t>Users have to indicate to their system in some way that they desire
      bootstrapping to be performed only when connecting to a specific network
      (e.g., organization for which a user works or a user works temporarily
      within another corporation), similar to the way users disable VPN
      connection in specific network (e.g., Enterprise network) and enable VPN
      connection by default in other networks. If the discovered DNS server
      meets the privacy preserving data policy requirements of the user, the
      user can select to use the discovered DoT and DoH servers.</t>

      <!--
      <t>If the client device joins an open WiFi network (that is, one without
      any security credentials) or joins a WiFi using a single shared
      password among all the attached devices (e.g., as commonly deployed
      with WPA2-Personal), such networks can be spoofed by an attacker
      hosting a fake access point with the same SSID and password.  With
      such WiFi networks, the client cannot know if the
      discovered DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS server is hosted by the
      legitimate network operator or by an attacker.

             title="Bootstrapping Endpoint Devices">
      <t>If a device is managed by an enterprise's IT department, the device
      can be configured to use Enterprise-provided DoH/DoT servers. This
      configuration might be manual or rely upon whatever deployed device
      management tool in an Enterprise. For example, customizing Firefox using
      Group Policy to use the Enterprise DoH server is discussed in <xref
      target="Firefox-Policy"></xref> for Windows and MacOS, and setting
      Chrome policies is discussed in <xref target="Chrome-Policy"></xref> and
      <xref target="Chrome-DoH"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If mobile device management (MDM) (e.g, <xref
      target="MDM-Apple"></xref>) is used to secure BYOD, MDM can be used to
      configure OS/browser with the Enterprise provided DoH/DoT server. If an
      endpoint is on-boarded, for example, using Over-The-Air (OTA) enrollment
      <xref target="OTA"></xref> to provision the device with a certificate
      and configuration profile, the configuration profile can include the
      authentication domain name (ADN) of the DoH/DoT server. The OS/Browser
      can use the configuration profile to use the Enterprise provided DoH/DoT
      server. In this case, MDM is not installed on the device.</t>

      <section anchor="bootstrap-byod" title="Bootstrapping BYOD">
        <t>This section focuses on bootstrapping Bring your own device (BYOD)
        to discover and authenticate DoH/DoT server provided by the enterprise
        network but without MDM or configuration profile on the endpoint. If
        an endpoint uses the credentials (username and password) provided by
        the IT admin to mutually authenticate to the Enterprise WLAN Access
        Point (e.g., PEAP-MSCHAPv2 <xref target="PEAP"></xref>, EAP-pwd <xref
        target="RFC8146"></xref>, EAP-PSK <xref target="RFC4764"></xref>), the
        following steps can be used to securely bootstrap the endpoint with
        the authentication domain name (ADN, defined in <xref
        target="RFC8310"></xref>) and DNS server certificate of the local
        network's DoH/DoT server:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The endpoint authenticates to the local network and discovers
            the Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref
            target="RFC7030"></xref> server using the procedure discussed in
            <xref target="EST_Discovery"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The endpoint establishes provisional TLS connection with that
            EST server, i.e., the endpoint provisionally accepts the
            unverified TLS server certificate. However, the endpoint MUST
            authenticate the EST server before it accepts the DNS server
            certificate. The endpoint either uses password-based authenticated
            key exchange (PAKE) with TLS 1.3 <xref
            target="I-D.barnes-tls-pake"></xref> as an authentication method
            or uses the mutual authentication protocol for HTTP <xref
            target="RFC8120"> </xref> to authenticate the discovered EST
            server. <vspace blankLines="1" />As a reminder, PAKE is an
            authentication method that allows the use of usernames and
            passwords over unencrypted channels without revealing the
            passwords to an eavesdropper. Similarly, the mutual authentication
            for HTTP is based on PAKE and provides mutual authentication
            between an HTTP client and an HTTP server using username and
            password as credentials. The cryptographic algorithms to use with
            the mutual authentication protocol for HTTP are defined in <xref
            target="RFC8121"></xref>. <vspace blankLines="1" />Note that the
            Crypto Forum Research Group (cfrg) has selected draft-haase-cpace
            and draft-krawczyk-cfrg-opaque drafts to recommend for balanced
            and augmented password-based authenticated key establishment in
            IETF protocols. This step will be further updated.<vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t>The endpoint needs to use PAKE scheme to perform authentication
            the first time it connects to an EST server. If the EST server
            authentication is successful, the server's identity can be used to
            authenticate subsequent TLS connections to that EST server. The
            endpoint configures the reference identifier for the EST server
            using the DNS-ID identifier type in the EST server certificate. On
            subsequent connections to the EST server, the endpoint MUST
            validate the EST server certificate using the Implict Trust Anchor
            database (i.e, the EST server certificate must pass PKIX
            certification path validation <xref target="RFC6125"></xref>) and
            match the reference identifier against the EST server's identity
            according to the rules specified in Section 6.4 of <xref
            target="RFC6125"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The endpoint learns the End-Entity certificates <xref
            target="RFC8295"></xref> from the EST server. The certificate
            provisioned to the DNS server in the local network will be treated
            as a End-Entity certificate. As a reminder, the End-Entity
            certificates must be validated by the endpoint using an authorized
            trust anchor (Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC8295"></xref>). The
            endpoint needs to identify the certificate provisioned to the DNS
            server. The SRV-ID identifier type <xref target="RFC6125"></xref>
            within subjectAltName entry MUST be used to identify the DNS
            server certificate. <vspace blankLines="1" />For example, DNS
            server certificate will include SRV-ID "_domain-s.example.net"
            along with DNS-ID "example.net". The SRV service label "domain-s"
            is defined in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC7858"></xref> for DoT
            protocol. The SRV service label "doh" is defined in <xref
            target="IANA"></xref> for DoH protocol.</t>

            <t>The endpoint configures the authentication domain name (ADN)
            (defined in <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>) for the DNS server
            from the DNS-ID identifier type within subjectAltName entry in the
            DNS server certificate. The DNS server certificate is associated
            with the ADN to be matched with the certificate given by the DNS
            server in TLS. To some extent, this approach is similar to
            certificate usage PKIX-EE(1) defined in <xref
            target="RFC7671"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The following steps explain the mechanism to bootstrap IoT devices
      supporting Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI)
      discussed in <xref

      network's CA certificates, ADN and DNS server certificate:</t>

          <t>Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) discussed
          in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"></xref>
          provides a solution for secure automated bootstrap of devices. BRSKI
          specifies means to provision credentials on devices to be used to
          operationally access networks. In addition, BRSKI provides an
          automated mechanism for the bootstrap distribution of CA
          certificates from the EST server. The IoT device can use BRSKI to
          bootstrap the IoT device using the IoT manufacturer provisioned
          X.509 certificate, in combination with a registrar provided by the
          local network and IoT device manufacturer's authorizing service
          (MASA):<list style="numbers">
              <t>The IoT device authenticates to the local network using the
              IoT manufacturer provisioned X.509 certificate. The IoT device
              can request and get a voucher from the MASA service via the
              registrar. The voucher is signed by the MASA service and
              includes the local network's CA public key.</t>

              <t>The IoT device validates the signed voucher using the
              manufacturer installed trust anchor associated with the MASA,
              stores the CA's public key and validates the provisional TLS
              connection to the registrar.</t>

              <t>The IoT device requests the full EST distribution of current
              CA certificates (Section 5.9.1 in <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"></xref>) from the
              registrar operating as a BRSKI-EST server. The IoT devices
              stores the CA certificates as Explicit Trust Anchor database
              entries. The IoT device uses the Explicit Trust Anchor database
              to validate the DNS server certificate.</t>

              <t>The IoT device learns the End-Entity certificates from the
              BRSKI-EST server. The certificate provisioned to the DNS server
              in the local network will be treated as an End-Entity
              certificate. The IoT device needs to identify the certificate
              provisioned to the DNS server. The SRV-ID identifier type within
              subjectAltName entry MUST be used to identify the DNS server
              certificate (see Step 4 in <xref
              target="bootstrap-byod"></xref>).</t>

              <t>The endpoint configures the ADN for the DNS server from the
              DNS-ID identifier type within subjectAltName entry in the DNS
              server certificate. The DNS server certificate is associated
              with the ADN to be matched with the certificate given by the DNS
              server in TLS.</t>

    <section anchor="auth" title="Connection Handshake and Service Invocation">
      <t>The DNS client resolves the ADN using the mechanism discussed in
      Section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>. The DNS client initiates
      TLS handshake with the DNS server, the DNS server presents its
      certificate in ServerHello message, and the DNS client MUST match the
      DNS server certificate downloaded in Step 4 in <xref
      target="bootstrap-byod"></xref> or <xref target="bootstrap-iot"></xref>
      with the certificate provided by the DNS server in TLS handshake. If the
      match is successful, the DNS client MUST validate the server certificate
      using an authorized trust anchor.</t>

      <t>If the match is successful and server certificate is successfully
      validated, the client continues with the connection as normal.
      Otherwise, the client MUST treat the server certificate validation
      failure as a non-recoverable error. If the DNS client cannot reach or
      establish an authenticated and encrypted connection with the
      privacy-enabling DNS server provided by the local network, the DNS
      client can fallback to a privacy-enabling public DNS server.</t>

    <section anchor="EST_Discovery" title="EST Service Discovery Procedure">
      <t>An EST client discovers the EST server in the local network by using
      DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) <xref target="RFC6763"></xref> or
      Multicast DNS (mDNS) <xref target="RFC6762"></xref>. The &lt;Domain&gt;
      portion specifies the DNS sub-domain where the service instance is
      registered. It may be "local.", indicating the mDNS local domain, or it
      may be a conventional domain name such as "example.com.". The
      &lt;Service&gt; portion of the EST service instance name MUST be
      "_est._tcp".</t>

      <t>A EST client application can proactively discover an EST server being
      advertised in the site by multicasting a PTR query to the following:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>"_est._tcp.local"</t>
        </list>An EST server can send out gratuitous multicast DNS answer
      packets whenever it starts up, wakes from sleep, or detects a change in
      EST server configuration. EST client application can receive these
      gratuitous packets and cache information contained in them.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="reattach" title="Network Reattachment">
      <t>On subsequent attachments to the network, the endpoint initiates TLS
      handshake with the DoH/DoT server (configured in Step 5 of <xref
      target="bootstrap-byod"></xref> or <xref target="bootstrap-iot"></xref>)
      and follows the mechanism discussed in <xref target="auth"></xref> to
      validate the DNS server certificate.</t>

      <t>If the DNS server certificate is invalid (e.g., revoked or expired),
      the endpoint discovers and initiates TLS handshake with the EST server,
      and uses the validation techniques described in <xref
      target="RFC6125"></xref> to compare the reference identifier (created in
      Step 2 of <xref target="bootstrap-byod"></xref> in this document) to the
      EST server certificate and verifies the entire certification path as per
      <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>. The endpoint then gets the DNS server
      certificate from the EST server. If the DNS-ID identifier type within
      subjectAltName entry in the DNS server certificate does not match the
      configured ADN, the ADN is replaced with the DNS-ID identifier type. The
      DNS server certificate associated with the ADN is replaced with the one
      provided by the EST server. The endpoint initiates TLS handshake with
      the newly discovered ADN and follows the mechanism discussed in <xref
      target="auth"></xref> to validate the DNS server certificate.</t>

    <section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t><xref target="RFC7626"></xref> discusses DNS privacy considerations
      in both "on the wire" (Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC7626"></xref>)
      and "in the server" (Section 2.5 of <xref target="RFC7626"></xref>
      contexts. The mechanism defined in <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref> can be used by
      the DNS server to communicate its privacy statement URL and filtering
      policy to a DNS client. This communication is cryptographically signed
      to attest to its authenticity. By evaluating the DNS privacy statement,
      filtering policy and the signatory, the client can use the discovered
      DNS server if it meets privacy preserving data policy and filtering
      requirements of the user.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The bootstrapping procedure to obtain the certificate of the local
      network's DNS server uses a client identity and password to authenticate
      the EST server using PAKE schemes. Security considerations such as those
      discussed in <xref target="I-D.barnes-tls-pake"></xref> or <xref
      target="RFC8120"></xref> and <xref target="RFC8121"></xref> need to be
      taken into consideration.</t>

      <t>Users cannot be expected to enable or disable the bootstrapping or
      the discovery procedure as they switch networks. Thus, it is RECOMMENDED
      that users indicate to their system in some way that they desire
      bootstrapping to be performed when connecting to a specific network,
      similar to the way users disable VPN connection in specific network
      (e.g., Enterprise network) and enable VPN connection by default in other
      networks.</t>

      <t>If an endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile, and the network
      security service blocks the traffic to the privacy-enabling public DNS
      server, a hard failure occurs and the user is notified. The user has a
      choice to switch to another network or if the user trusts the network,
      the user can enable strict privacy profile with the DoH/DoT server
      discovered in the network instead of downgrading to opportunistic
      privacy profile.</t>

      <t>The primary attacks against the methods described in <xref
      target="EST_Discovery"></xref> are the ones that would lead to
      impersonation of a EST server and spoofing the DNS response to indicate
      that the network does not support any EST server. To protect against
      DNS-vectored attacks, secured DNS (DNSSEC) can be used to ensure the
      validity of the DNS records received. Impersonation of the EST server is
      prevented by authenticating the EST server using the PAKE scheme. The
      PAKE scheme is only used once to configure the reference identifier of
      the EST server and the server certificate is validated for subsequent
      TLS connections to the EST server.</t>

      <t>Security considerations in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"></xref> need to be taken
      into consideration for IoT devices.</t>
